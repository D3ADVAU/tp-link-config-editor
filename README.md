# TP-Link Router Config Editor

A web interface to edit TP-Link Router Config export files (typically named
`config.bin`).

[Visit the website](https://jahed.github.io/tplink-config-editor/).

Tested on an
[MR600v2](https://www.tp-link.com/uk/support/download/archer-mr600/). Other
router models may be supported but use with caution.

While there are some safety nets, there's no guarantee your changes will work on
your router. **Any damage caused by invalid configuration is your own
responsibility!**
